# Resume Data Analysis - Factors Influencing Callback Rates

## Overview:
The aim of this project is to study the factors which influece job application callback rates with a special focus on Race and Gender.

The [Resume Dataset](https://www.openintro.org/data/index.php?data=resume) from OpenIntro library in R is used for this analysis. The outcome variable is binary in nature (received or didn't receive callback) and hence a **Logistic Regression Model** has been used to make an **Inference** on the factors (esp. Race and Gender) which may impact the callback rate.
